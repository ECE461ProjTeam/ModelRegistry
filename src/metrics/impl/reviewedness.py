class ReviewednessMetric:
    """
    Measures the fraction of recent code that was introduced through reviewed PRs.
    
    Analyzes the last 500 merged PRs to evaluate current code review practices.
    This focuses on recent development quality (typically ~1 year for active repos)
    rather than entire project history, providing a more relevant metric for 
    assessing ongoing maintenance and current team practices.
    
    Returns:
        - value: Fraction of lines in recent PRs that came from reviewed PRs (0.0 to 1.0)
        - binary: 1 if â‰¥50% of recent code was reviewed, 0 otherwise
        - -1.0 if no GitHub repository or no PR data available
